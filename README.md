# MadCityMouseSpeed
This script adjusts the mouse speed when equipping guns or other utilities in Mad City: Chapter 1.
This was made because in the game, your mouse speed becomes drastically smaller when you equip guns or other things.
When you unequip it, it restores to its original speed.

Before running the script, ensure that you have installed:
!pip install keyboard ctypes
